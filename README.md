__Foulkon__ is an authorization server that allows or denies the access to web resources.

## Installation / usage

- Proxy: This proxies the requests to the authorization server (worker).

## Limitations

Since validation is different in each identity provider, Foulkon needs __ID Token__ instead of __Access Token__ in order to check user permissions
in Authorization header with type bearer.
E.g.:

```
GET /example/resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
  Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjFlOWdkazcifQ.ewogImlzcyI6ICJodHRwOi8vc2VydmVyLmV4YW1wbGUuY29tIiwKICJzdWIiOiAiMjQ4Mjg5NzYxMDAx
